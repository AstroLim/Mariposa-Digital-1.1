# Mariposa-Digital
A rice & lot rental provider app that offers real time updates on our products and services with seamless customer support.

# Problem
Currently, when customers and other business owners contact Mariposa Inc., they 
usually reach out to the owners directly, whether it's regarding orders for sacks of rice or 
inquiries about the rental spaces in front of the building. This can lead to issues such as 
missed or delayed responses to customer concerns, which may negatively affect 
communication quality and potentially result in the loss of customers.

# Solution
To address this, we propose developing a web application to manage orders and 
rentals. Through the web application, clients can log in to their accounts to place orders 
and specify the desired quantities. They can also view updates on available rental 
spaces, reserve rentals, and pay their rent online. Additionally, Mariposa staff & Main 
Admin will have their own accounts to manage orders and rentals efficiently. Overall, 
this web application aims to improve communication, enhance operational efficiency, 
and uphold the companyâ€™s reputation for excellent customer service.
